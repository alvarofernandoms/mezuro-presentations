We use 2 methods of recording video and audio:

First method (simplescreenrecorder):
	Install simplescreenrecorder and follow the instructions.

Second method (ffmpeg):

Use 'aplay -l' to discover your capture device.

$ aplay -l

Use ffmpeg to do the magic: (Substitute hw:0,0 by your aplay -l output, first number is your card and second number is your device)

$ ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0,0 -f x11grab -s $(xwininfo -root | grep 'geometry' | awk '{print $2;}') -r 25 -i :0.0 -vcodec mpeg2video -ar 44100 -s wvga -y -sameq sample.mpg
