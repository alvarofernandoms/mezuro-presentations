This paper presented the evolution of Mezuro -- a free software platform that
is part of a new generation of source code metrics analysis tools.  It has
useful features for both software engineer and researcher working with source
code analysis. Mezuro is fully flexible allowing easy integration with distinct
source code collector. Also, it provides an environment where software
engineers can define their own threshold configurations, according to software
implementation context and their experiences. These thresholds are shared among
other software engineers on the Mezuro plaform.  In short, each metric loaded
can support as many thresholds as possible to provide a full interpretation
about what a metric value means.

Future works include the support of other metric collector tools, especially
to provide Python and Ruby source code analysis.
