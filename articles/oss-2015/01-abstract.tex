Source code metrics are not new but have not yet been fully explored in
software development. Also, despite the ``show me the code'' culture, source
code metrics are often not perceived as an indicator of free software quality.

To promote the use of source code metrics, we have defined an approach and
developed a platform to use, interpret, and understand software metrics.

Mezuro aims to improve the readability of source code metrics. It shows metric
results in a friendly way, helping software engineers to spot design flaws to
refactor, project managers to control source code quality, and software
adopters and researchers to compare specific source code characteristics across
free software projects.
