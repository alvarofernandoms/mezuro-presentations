	Abstract = {Several factors may impact the process of software maintenance and evolution of free software projects, including structural complexity and lack of control over its contributors. Structural complexity, an architectural concern, makes software projects more difficult to understand, and consequently more difficult to maintain and evolve. The contributors in a free software project exhibit different levels of participation in the project, and can be categorized as core and peripheral developers. This research aims at characterizing the changes made to the source code of 7 web server projects written in C with respect to the amount of structural complexity added or removed and the developer level of participation. We performed a field experiment and collected data from the version control repositories of those projects, recording Structural Complexity information for each change as well as identifying each change as performed by a core or a peripheral developer. We have found that core developers introduce less Structural Complexity than peripheral developers in general, and that in the case of complexity-reducing activities, core developers remove more Structural Complexity than peripheral developers. These results demonstrate the importance of having a stable and healthy core team to the sustainability of free software projects.},

 Abstract = {Recently, I became interested in a current debate over whether file size
distributions are best modelled by a power law distribution or a lognormal distribution.
In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich
and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from
the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here,
I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that
lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions
connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions
have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce and analyze a new, dynamic generative user
model to explain the behavior of file size distributions. Our Recursive Forest File model
combines multiplicative models that generate lognormal distributions with recent work
on random graph models for the web. Unlike similar previous work, our Recursive
Forest File model allows new files to be created and old files to be deleted over time, and
our analysis covers problematic issues such as correlation among file sizes. Moreover,
our model allows natural variations where files that are copied or modified are more
likely to be copied or modified subsequently.
Previous empirical work suggests that file sizes tend to have a lognormal body but a
Pareto tail. The Recursive Forest File model explains this behavior, yielding a double
Pareto distribution, which has a Pareto tail but close to a lognormal body. We believe
the Recursive Forest model may be useful for describing other power law phenomena
in computer systems as well as other fields.

abstract={The statistical distributions of different software properties have been thoroughly studied in the past, including software size, complexity and the n. of defects. In the case of object-oriented systems, these distributions have been found to obey a power law, a common statistical distribution also found in many other fields. However, we have found that for some statistical properties, the behavior does not entirely follow a power law, but a mixture between a lognormal and a power law distribution. Our study is based on the Qualitas Corpus, a large compendium of diverse Java-based software projects. We have measured the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics suite for every file of every Java project in the corpus. Our results show that the range of high values for the different metrics follows a power law distribution, whereas the rest of the range follows a lognormal distribution. This is a pattern typical of so-called double Pareto distributions, also found in empirical studies for other software properties.},

@article{clauset2007,
    abstract = {{Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.}},
